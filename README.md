# Software Security CTF Challenge

## Project Overview

**Project Link:** [Software Security CTF Challenge](https://cs4401.walls.ninja/)

This project involved the exploration and exploitation of software vulnerabilities through a series of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. Each challenge is included in this repository, providing an opportunity to enhance your skills in software security and binary exploitation.

### Key Activities
- **Reverse Engineering:** Delve into binary executables using C and x86-64 assembly language to understand their inner workings.
- **Vulnerability Identification:** Analyze C binaries to identify common software defects such as buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, and use-after-free issues.
- **Advanced Exploitation Techniques:** Explore advanced techniques for binary exploitation, including but not limited to return-oriented programming (ROP) and return-to-libc attacks.

## Challenges

Each challenge within this repository is designed to provide hands-on experience in tackling specific aspects of software security. The challenges cover a range of topics, including reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, and web application exploitation.
